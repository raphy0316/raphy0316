# Hi, I'm Raphael (Hyuntaek) Oh

I'm a **full-stack software engineer & CS student at UW–Madison (Fall 2026)**.  
I build **AI-powered systems**, **real-time collaboration tools**, and **scalable backend infrastructure**.  
My work focuses on **multimodal AI**, **retrieval systems (RAG, vector search, BM25)**,  
and **ML-powered user experiences**.
